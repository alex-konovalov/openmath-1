This package is installed as a normal Gap package: see Gap reference
manual, chapter "74 GAP Packages" (and if you don't have write access to
the Gap installation see also section "9.2 GAP Root Directory"), for
details.

This package suggests compilation, and the complilation is non-standard:
see README file for details.

cd pkg/openmath

cd OMCv1.3c/src/
./configure
make
cd ../../
./configure ../../
make


The part in C language compiles and runs also on Windows with Cygwin 
(see http://www.cygwin.com/).
A Windows user may also try to get a precompiled OMC binary from
ftp://ftp-sop.inria.fr/safir/OM (I didn't try), and thereafter

cd pkg/openmath

./configure ../../
make
