The &GAP; package &openmath; provides an &OpenMath; phrasebook for &GAP;: 
it allows &GAP; users to import and export mathematical objects encoded in 
&OpenMath;, for the purpose of exchanging them with other applications which 
are &OpenMath;-enabled. 
<P/>

For further information about &OpenMath; standard see the &OpenMath; homepage
<URL>http://www.openmath.org</URL>.
<P/>

The &openmath; package will be useful only if used in conjunction with any
other &OpenMath;-enabled application. For the automated exchange of the
&OpenMath;-encoded data with other compliant applications, we suggest to
use the &GAP; package &SCSCP; (<Cite Key="SCSCPpkg"/>) which implements
the Symbolic Computation Software Composability 
protocol (<Cite Key="SCSCPspec"/>) for the &GAP; system, providing suport
for &OpenMath; content dictionaries &scscp1; and &scscp2; 
(<Cite Key="scscp1cd"/>, <Cite Key="scscp2cd"/>).
<P/>

To use &openmath; package it is required to install the &GAPDoc; package
<Cite Key="GAPDoc"/> to use &openmath; help system and parse &OpenMath;
objects in XML encoding.
<P/>

To install &openmath; package, unpack the archive and place the <File>openmath</File>
directory in the <File>pkg</File> subdirectory of your &GAP;4.4 installation. 
When you don't have access to the directory of your main &GAP; 
installation, you can also install the package 
<E>outside the &GAP; main directory</E>
by unpacking it inside a directory <File>MYGAPDIR/pkg</File>. 
Then to be able to load &openmath; you need to call GAP with the 
<C>-l ";MYGAPDIR"</C> option.
<P/>

The package comes together with the program <File>gpipe</File> which should be
used to parse binary &OpenMath; format. To compile binaries, do the following:

<Example>
<![CDATA[
cd pkg/openmath
cd OMCv1.3c/src/
./configure
make
cd ../../
./configure ../../
make
]]>
</Example>

However, it is fine to ignore this step if binary &OpenMath; format will not
be used.
