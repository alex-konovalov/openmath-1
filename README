                           The OpenMath Package
                           --------------------

The package provides an OpenMath phrasebook for GAP: it allows GAP 
users to import and export mathematical objects encoded in OpenMath, 
for the purpose of exchanging them with other OpenMath-enabled 
applications. 

Copyright:
==========

The OpenMath package is free software; you can redistribute it and/or 
modify it under the terms of the GNU General Public License as published 
by the Free Software Foundation; either version 2 of the License, or 
(at your option) any later version. For details, see the FSF's own site
http://www.gnu.org/licenses/gpl.html.

Additionally, it contains code developed at INRIA (copyright INRIA), 
under the ESPRIT project number 24969 (OpenMath). The user may not use 
the library in commercial products without seeking permission from the 
GAP group (support@gap-system.org) and the CAFE team at INRIA SA 
(stephane.dalmas@sophia.inria.fr).

Installation:
=============

This package is installed as a normal Gap package: see Gap reference
manual, chapter "74 GAP Packages" (and if you don't have write access to
the Gap installation see also section "9.2 GAP Root Directory"), for
details.

This package suggests compilation, and the complilation is non-standard:
see README file for details.

cd pkg/openmath

cd OMCv1.3c/src/
./configure
make
cd ../../
./configure ../../
make


The part in C language compiles and runs also on Windows with Cygwin 
(see http://www.cygwin.com/).
A Windows user may also try to get a precompiled OMC binary from
ftp://ftp-sop.inria.fr/safir/OM (I didn't try), and thereafter

cd pkg/openmath

./configure ../../
make

Some historical notes from previous releases and changelogs
are collected below.

The compilation is non-standard! See below.

This package has been developed to allow GAP users to
import and export mathematical objects encoded in OpenMath,
for the purpose of exchanging them with other applications that
are OpenMath enabled.


1. Copyright

This package is distributed under GPL license and the terms of the GAP
copyright. Additionally, it contains code developed at INRIA
(copyright INRIA), under the ESPRIT project number 24969 (OpenMath).
The user may not use the library in commercial products without seeking
permission from the GAP group (support@gap-system.org) and the 
CAFE team at  INRIA SA (stephane.dalmas@sophia.inria.fr).

It may be redistributed ``as is'' together with this notice.


2. Technicalities and installation

This package includes a C program, and works with full functionality
only if this program has been compiled.

To install this package (after extracting the packages archive
file to the GAP pkg directory):

a) go to the directory `pkg/openmath/OMCv1.3c/src' and call 

/bin/sh ./configure

and then call `make' to compile the INRIA library (producing libOM.a).


b) go to the directory `pkg/openmath' (the
directory containing this README file) and call

/bin/sh ./configure <path>

where <path> is a path to the main GAP root directory (so normally you would
call /bin/sh ./configure ../..).

afterwards call `make' to compile the binary. See file examples for usage examples.

c) you also need to modify the file hasse/config.g
to make the Hasse diagram stuff work.


3. The INRIA library

The files in the directory `openmath/OMCv1.3c' are the OpenMath C library
version 1.3c developed by the CAFE group at INRIA SA. For the latest 
version, contact: stephane.dalmas@sophia.inria.fr , or try
ftp://ftp-sop.inria.fr/safir/OM .

June 2004: I have done some modifications in this package, in order to
make it usable again:

provided a PackageInfo.g file (this file is needed by GAP 4.4);

changed in several points ``share package'' into ``package'' as now the
term ``share'' is obsolete;

slight modifications in the file doc/make_doc;

the warning ``The compilation is non-standard! See below.'' above.

After agreement with Andrew Solomon, I will be the maintainer of this
package. I have done the modifications listed below, which were
necessary in order to extend the functionality and to fix the bugs, and
because both OpenMath and the package mechanism of GAP have evolved
in the meantime.

This package performs the conversion from GAP to OpenMath, using only
GAP code, and this part is expected to work on each machine on which
GAP works. This package performs also the conversion from OpenMath to
GAP, either using a function from the GAP package ``GapDoc'', or
using an external program (which is included in the package, is
written in C, and needs to be compiled); autodetection is used.


The list of supported OpenMath Content Dictionaries (CDs) is implicit in
the code. 

For the supported CDs and symbols when converting from OpenMath to
GAP, see the files gap/gap.g, variables OMsymTable and
OMnullarySymbolToGAP, and gap/new.g.

/* Remark: from version 9.4.0, OMnullarySymbolToGAP no longer
exists, and OMsymTable was converted into OMsymRecord */

For the supported CDs and symbols when converting from GAP to
OpenMath, see the files gap/omput.gi, method for OMPut (and
hasse/hasse.g for the Hasse diagram).

If you modify the code to add support for other CDs, please inform me,
so that your modifications can be included in a new version of this
package.

List of main modifications made by Marco Costantini to the original
package by Andrew Solomon (technical).

* file pkg/openmath/gap/gap.g
  - Updated function ``OMnullarySymbolToGAP'' according to the
    current OpenMath CDs.

* added file pkg/openmath/gap/new.g that contains
  - Update to function OMsymTable, according to the current
    OpenMath CDs (for converting from OpenMath to GAP).

* file pkg/openmath/gap/lex.g
  - Added support for XML escaped characters.

* file pkg/openmath/gap/parse.gi
  - Added support for the new OpenMath 2.0 objects that contain
    information inside the OMOBJ tag.
  - Now ``gpipe'' is called using Process instead of Exec 
    (this increases both the performance and the portability).

* added files xmltree.gd and xmltree.gi that contain
  - A function that converts the OpenMath XML into a tree and
    parses it.

* file pkg/openmath/gap/pipeobj.g
  - Added support for conversion of OpenMath objects with binary
    encoding, from OpenMath to GAP.
  - Added support for comment along the streams, between
    OpenMath objects.

* file pkg/openmath/gap/omget.g
  - Now OMGetObject doesn't hang any more when OpenMath object is
    not retrieved.
  - Now OMGetObject closes the files that is has opened.
  - Modified also to avoid using a new temporary directory for
    each call of OMGetObject.

* file pkg/openmath/gap/omput.gi 
  - Updated and fixed functions ``OMPut'' and related, according
    to the current OpenMath CDs.
  - Simplified the code for the OMPutby methods, by introducing
    OMPutApplication and using OMPutSymbol.
  - Added OMPut methods for infinity, a range, a float, Rationals,
    Integers, NonnegativeIntegers (for converting from GAP to OpenMath).
  - Fixed OMPut method for cyclotomics. Now it is correct for
    GaussianRationals and infinity.
  - Added a SetPrintFormattingStatus in OMWriteLine, to fix
    conversion of long objects.
  - Fixed some typos.

* Added file pkg/openmath/hasse/config.g
  - Removed unnecessay INSTALLATION_PATH 
  - Warning about SERVLET

* file pkg/openmath/PackageInfo.g
  - Provided an up-to-date, informative, complete and working 
    PackageInfo.g file.

* file pkg/openmath/init.g
  - Moved here reading of \*.gd files from read.g
  - Removed the outdated stuff

* file pkg/openmath/read.g
  - Now the is clearly indiceted which is the interdependence 
    of the files in the package.
  - Reads the file pkg/openmath/gap/new.g above.
  - Moved reading of \*.gd files to file init.g
  - Converted ReadPkg to ReadPackage
  - Removed banner (moved to PackageInfo.g file)

* added files pkg/openmath/tst/test_new, pkg/openmath/tst/test_new.src, 
  pkg/openmath/tst/test_new.omt
  - Provided a test file.

* file pkg/openmath/doc/openmath.msk
  - Fixed the examples, to make them to look exactly like in GAP.

* file pkg/openmath/README (this file)
  - Updated, added more information and the list of
    modifications.

* files pkg/openmath/examples and pkg/openmath/hasse/example
  - Converted RequirePackage to LoadPackage
  - Added some notes

* in various files
  - Refactored the code, so that the code is splitted into
    several independent modules (see file read.g).
  - Added commands to close all the streams.
  - Modified to fit with the file structure prescribed in the
    ``ext'' manual.
  - various minor changes.

* Now the package loads, and provides conversion from GAP to
  OpenMath, even if the external binary has not been compiled. 
  In this case, if the conversion from OpenMath to GAP is 
  attempted, an informative error message is issued.

Since 2007 Alexander Konovalov made several further changes 
in this package and after an agreement with Andrew Solomon 
became its maintainer. The list of major updates is below:

* Fixes of names of symbols and their distribution across 
  CDs following recent changes in OpenMath CDs.
  
* Multiple additions and updates to support various symbols 
  from CDs alg1, algnums, arith1, arith2, arith3, calculus1, 
  comnbinat1, fieldname1, group1, group2, group, groupname1, 
  integer1, integer2, list1, logic1, permgp1, set1.
  
* Extended support of polynomial CDs.

* Fixed and extended support of OpenMath references.

* Fixed error messages for unexpected_symbol, unhandled_symbol, 
  unsupported_CD as required by the 'error' OM CD.
    
* Changes in conversion from GAP to OpenMath:
- introduced OMINT_LIMIT and fixed OMput for integers too 
  large to be printed.
- commented out method for OMPut( <stream>,  <vector> ) to 
  have the default output as list1.list.
  
* OMsymTable turned from the list of nested lists into a 
  record and renamed to OMsymRecord.

* Removed OMnullarySymbolToGAP, now all lookup is performed 
  by OMsymLookup with no distinction between nullary and
  n-ary OpenMath symbols.
  
* New functionality:
  - New function OMPutObjectNoOMOBJtags, a variation of the 
    function OMPutObject to write to the stream the OpenMath
    object without enclosing <OMOBJ> .. </OMOBJ> tags, which 
    may be useful for combining complex objects.
  - New objects OMPlainString which are strings of OpenMath
    code that are plainly substituted into the output while
    printing/writing into stream instead of converting to
    OMSTR, which may be useful for composing OpenMath code
    from GAP.
  - New function OMString to return a string with the 
    OpenMath representation of a GAP object.     
    
* Better organising of handling private CDs/symbols:
  - created directory 'openmath/private' to store implementations 
    of our private CDs and private/experimental symbols (this is
    also the place where users may put their code if they will 
    need to addsupport for their own private CDs)
  - moved to 'openmath/private/private.g' code for algnums and 
    cas CDs, for our versions of groups1.group and permgp1.group
    and groups1.character_table, groups1.character_table_of_group
  - transformed OM_append into two functions OM_append_new and 
    OM_append_private.

* multiple rearrangements of declaring and assigning global 
  variables and moving of reading *.g files from read.g to 
  init.g to fix errors when OpenMath is loaded as required 
  package from other package.
  
* Converted the manual into GAPDoc format and extended it.

* Various technical changes:
  - updated PackageInfo.g file
  - removed the non-standard banner 
  - removed INSTALL file containig duplicated information
  - added openmatj/gap/buildman.g with utility functions
    to build the manual
  - rewrote the README file which is also the changelog
  - changed the system of version numbers
